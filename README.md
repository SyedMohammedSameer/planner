## ✨ About Salsabil

Salsabil is a modern web application that beautifully combines productivity management with spiritual growth tracking. Named after the blessed spring in Jannah (Paradise) mentioned in the Quran, Salsabil helps you nourish both your worldly goals and spiritual journey.

> *"A fountain there, called Salsabil"* - Quran 76:18
